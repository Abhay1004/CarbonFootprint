# carbonfootprint

Climate change poses an urgent threat, with individual carbon footprints significantly impacting greenhouse gas emissions. Quantifying these footprints can empower individuals to make informed decisions toward reducing environmental impact. This project aims to develop a machine learning (ML) system for accurately and efficiently calculating individual carbon footprints.

Our approach leverages ML techniques to analyze diverse contributors to carbon emissions: transportation habits, energy usage, dietary preferences, and lifestyle behaviors. Data from personal surveys, activity trackers, energy bills, and environmental databases serve as key sources.

The project comprises crucial phases: data preprocessing, feature engineering, model selection, and evaluation. We explore regression, classification, and clustering algorithms to predict and classify carbon footprints based on input features. Moreover, employing model explainability techniques yields insights into footprint determinants.

The project's pinnacle is a user-friendly application/platform enabling individuals to input data and receive personalized footprint insights. By fostering awareness and offering actionable recommendations, our project aims to empower sustainable choices and contribute to combating climate change at the individual level.
